# 1.7

good-enough? is not very good for finding the square root of very small numbers because .001 is not small enough to test 
even smaller numbers. The loop will exit because we are within the threshold, even though we aren't close to the proper value. 
We could continue making the test number smaller, but we would have the same issue as we continued to get smaller.
since the tests use limited precision large numbers will never achieve the degree of accuaracy required. 
Improve will never actually improve because the decimals will get rounded, or truncated. 
The program will run in an endless loop since it can't improve. Changing the good-enough? 
test to test for the change in the guesses with a small fraction of the guess makes it so that sqrt can handle 
smaller and larger numbers. Below is my solution.

```racket
#lang typed/racket

(: square (-> Float Float))
(define (square x) (* x x))

(: average (-> Float Float Float))
(define (average x y) (/ (+ x y) 2))

(: improve (-> Float Float Float))
(define (improve guess x) (average guess (/ x guess)))

(: new-good-enough? (-> Float Float Boolean))
(define (new-good-enough? guess old-guess)
  (<= (abs (- old-guess guess)) (* guess 0.001)))

(: sqrt-iter (-> Float Float Float Float))
(define (sqrt-iter guess old-guess x)
  (if (new-good-enough? guess old-guess)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) guess
                 x)))

(: sqrt (-> Float Float))
(define (sqrt x) (sqrt-iter 1.0 0.0 x))
```
