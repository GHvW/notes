applicative-order (Lisp uses applicative)
```scheme
(test 0 (p))
;;; to
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
;;; to
(0)
;;; to
0
```

the if statement gets evaluated first, since it evaluates to true, 0 is returned and (p) is never evaluated

normal-order
```scheme
(test 0 (p))
;;; to
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
;;; to
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
;;; to
(if (= 0 0) 0 (p))
```

will never finish because it constantly tryies to evalueat p into something it can operate on, but can't

# 1.6
since (new-if) is a function, all of it's arguments get evaluated like any other function before moving on, because of applicative-order evaluation. When the interpreter tries to evaluate the second argument it gets stuck recursively trying to evaluate the second argument.
