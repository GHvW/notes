Exercise 2.5

```scala
def compose[A, B, C](f: B => C, g: A => B): A => C = a => f(g(a))

def greeter(name: String): String = s"Greetings! My name is ${name}"

def strLen(s: String): Int = s.length

val greetingLen = compose(strLen, greeter)

println(s"Greeting length is: ${greetingLen("Garrett")}")
```
